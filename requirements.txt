# ^^ Development environment, as of June 2023, Linux Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 11, macOS 13.4
# pyamg is used only with size_it_RW.py for run random_walker

# Note that for PyCharm 2023, to get opencv documentation working, the interpreter
#  needs to use opencv-python 4.5.5.62. Higher versions with PIP installation
#  don't do opencv documentation.
